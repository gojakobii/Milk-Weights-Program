# Milk-Weights-Program

Our milkweights program will interact the user to prompt what kind of report the user desire. Once selected, depending on the report type, the user will be prompted for more specific information to display. Once the data is displayed, the user will have the option to add, remove, or edit the data. They will also have an option to change the type of report. THis will all be done through JavaFX.
